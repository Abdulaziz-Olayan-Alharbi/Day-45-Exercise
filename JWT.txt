JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact for transmitting data as a JSON object, and it is considered reliable because it contains a digital signature. When the JWT is encrypted, it can be used for user authentication and authorization.

JWT consists of three main components. The first is the header, which includes the type of token (in this case, JWT) and the algorithm used, whether it's a secret or a public/private key. The second component is the payload, which contains the user-specific data being transmitted, such as the ID or role. The third component is the signature, which is used to encrypt or decrypt the token.

When a user logs in, Spring Security authenticates the user. If authentication is successful, a JWT is generated and sent back to the client, JWT can be used for user authorization.
The JWT compact is considered secure, reliable, and easy to pass and use. Additionally, it eliminates the need for the server to store sessions, which helps in scaling the application.
